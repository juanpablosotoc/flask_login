The way to implement a complete user system is to 
either use only oauth for both login and registering and 
never keeping passwords or only being able to register using 
internal authentication, saving their passwords and then being 
able to login with internalk authentication by providing that 
password or oauth and ensuring that that email belongs to you 
and be can therefore log you in.

I am going to implement the ladder, a internal auth register system
meaning i keep a their passwords and an internal and oauth login
to log them in.
